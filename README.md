Project Name:A Hybrid Multi-Task Learning Approach for Efficient UAV Signal Identification

Project Description:The improper use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised numerous privacy and security concerns, necessitating the development of efficient Identification technologies. Considering the inherent differences in onboard equipment, UAV signals exhibit unique Orthogonal/In-phase (IQ) and Amplitude/Phase (AP) features.To address this, this project leverages the intrinsic correlation between these two features, extracting IQ and AP signal characteristics independently as sub-tasks. A Multi-Task Convolutional and LSTM Networks with Efficient Channel Attention (MCL-ECA) model is proposed. The hybrid architecture based on CNN and LSTM is employed to efficiently extract sequential data features for complex identification tasks, while the ECA mechanism is used to capture local dependencies through local channel interactions, further enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish features. Additionally, UAV signal category information is extracted by jointly leveraging IQ and AP signal features. 

Explanation of Project Files:The file "I_6AssistantLossBackward.py" is the model file proposed by this project. The remaining files, namely "I_7_ME-CLN_CrossEntropy.py", "I_8_M-CLN_CrossEntropy.py" and "I_9M-CLN_CompositeCrossEntropy.py", are ablation models. One uses the Cross Entropy (CE) loss function, one uses the Composite Cross Entropy (CCE) loss function without the Enhanced Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism, and one uses the Cross Entropy (CE) loss function without the Enhanced Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism.
